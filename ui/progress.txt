# Progress Log

Project: loopship-ui
Started: 2026-01-07
Goal: Premium dark UI for LoopShip loop monitoring

## Design Decisions

- Near-black background (#0a0a0a) not dark gray
- Amber-500 as only accent color
- Inter + Geist Mono fonts
- Minimal, no decorative elements
- Think: Linear, Raycast, Vercel dashboard

## Learnings

### Story 1: Project scaffold with Vite + React + Tailwind
- Vite 7.x with @tailwindcss/vite plugin is the modern way (not PostCSS config)
- Tailwind 4 uses `@import "tailwindcss"` instead of the old @tailwind directives
- Google Fonts provides both Inter and Geist Mono
- Keep the base component minimal - just a centered h1 on the dark background
- Screenshot verified: near-black (#0a0a0a) background with centered "LoopShip" title
